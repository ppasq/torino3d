Torino3d
========

Torino3d benefits from OSM Buildings JavaScript library for visualizing 3D building geometry on interactive maps.
It is based on <a href="https://github.com/talltom/3DLondon">Tomas Holderness' 3D London</a> functions and updated for <a href="https://github.com/kekscom/osmbuildings">OSM Buildings version 0.1.9a</a>.

Buildings geometry from <a href="http://www.pcn.minambiente.it/">Portale Cartografico Nazionale</a> have been stored in PostGIS and returned as GeoJSON within specified bounding box.
